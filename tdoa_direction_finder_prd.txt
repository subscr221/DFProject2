# TDOA Direction Finder System PRD
*High-Performance Multi-Node Signal Geolocation System*

## Overview
The Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) Direction Finder is a sophisticated electromagnetic spectrum monitoring and geolocation system operating across the 100-6000MHz frequency range. The system employs multiple synchronized receiver nodes to detect, analyze, and precisely locate RF signal sources with a Circular Error Probable (CEP) within 50 meters at 20 kilometers range.

This system serves two primary market segments:
- **Military applications**: Signal intelligence (SIGINT), electronic warfare support, threat detection, and secure communications monitoring
- **Commercial applications**: Spectrum management, regulatory compliance verification, interference detection, and unauthorized transmission identification

The system's value proposition lies in its ability to provide accurate signal geolocation in complex RF environments, its flexibility in deployment scenarios (fixed, mobile, portable), and its capability to detect and demodulate multiple signal types simultaneously at high sensitivity levels (Maker-shack and below).
